# Color_Identifier-HTML

This project contains an HTML file with embedded JavaScript that allows users to upload an image, click on any point on the image, and get the color at that point in hexadecimal format.

## Description

The web application allows users to identify the color of any pixel in an uploaded image by clicking on the desired point. The color is displayed as a hexadecimal code.

## Setup

1. **Download the HTML File**:
   - Save the provided [`HTML code`](color_identifier.html) to a file named `color_identifier.html`.

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Simply open the `color_identifier.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Click the  `Choose File` button to upload an image from your computer.

2. **Click on the Image**:
   - After the image loads, click on any point in the image to get the color of that point.

3. **View the Hexadecimal Color Code**:
   - The hexadecimal code for the selected color will be displayed below the image.

## Example

1. **Upload**: Upload any image file (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`).
2. **Click**: Click on a part of the image, and the script will show you the color at that point in hex format.

For example:

Selected Color: #ff5733

This output means that the color at the clicked point is `#ff5733`.
